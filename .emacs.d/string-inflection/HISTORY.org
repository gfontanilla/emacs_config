* HISTORY

** Version 1.0.10

   Merged [[https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection/pull/26][PR #26]] Add `Capital_Underscore_Form`

   add string-inflection-capital-underscore function

   The behavior of =string-inflection-all-cycle= has changed

#+BEGIN_SRC
before: foo_bar => FOO_BAR => FooBar => fooBar => foo-bar => foo_bar
after:  foo_bar => FOO_BAR => FooBar => fooBar => foo-bar => Foo_Bar => foo_bar
#+END_SRC

** Version 1.0.9

   Bugfix [[https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection/issues/27][issue #25]] When executing kebab-case etc., point advances to the next word, and the previous word can not be converted continuously

** Version 1.0.8

   [[https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection/issues/25][issue #25]]

   When it is simply =camelcase=, it means the name with the leading letters in lowercase.

   The name with the initial capital letter is called the =pascal-case=.

*** Behavior of the camelcase function has changed

    | Before | After  |
    |--------+--------|
    | FooBar | fooBar |

*** Function name changed as well

    | Before          | After       |
    |-----------------+-------------|
    | camelcase       | pascal-case |
    | lower-camelcase | camelcase   |

*** Add alias

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(fset 'string-inflection-upper-camelcase-function 'string-inflection-pascal-case-function)
(fset 'string-inflection-lower-camelcase-function 'string-inflection-camelcase-function)

(fset 'string-inflection-upper-camelcase-p 'string-inflection-pascal-case-p)
(fset 'string-inflection-lower-camelcase-p 'string-inflection-camelcase-p)
    #+END_SRC

*** Remove camelize function

    Originally we had defined functions of both =camelcase= and =camelize= names.

    I deleted the function containing =camelize= to make it simple.
