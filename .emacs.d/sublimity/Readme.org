* sublimity.el

sublime text風のぬるぬるスクロール＆ミニマップ

smooth-scrolling and minimap, like sublime editor

** THE VERSION 1.2.0 OF "sublimity-scroll.el" BROKE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

Now variables "sublimity-scroll-weight1/2" are not useful. To
configure the speed of scroll, use "sublimity-scroll-weight" and
"sublimity-scroll-drift-length" instead.

** Installation

Require this script and some of "sublimity-scroll" "sublimity-map".

: (require 'sublimity)
: (require 'sublimity-scroll)
: (require 'sublimity-map)

and call command "M-x sublimity-mode".

If you want to enable sublimity everywhere, call function
sublimity-global-mode instead.

: (sublimity-global-mode)

** Notes

When you load this script, "auto-hscroll-mode" is automatically
disabled, and "sublimity-auto-hscroll-mode" will work
instead. Therefore, to disable horizontal scrolling, set
"sublimity-auto-hscroll-mode" but not "auto-hscroll-mode".

** sublimity-scroll Settings

You may configure speed of scroll by setting two variables.

: (setq sublimity-scroll-weight 10
:       sublimity-scroll-drift-length 5)

scroll is divided into (about) =weight + drift-length= steps. for
example, with the configuration above, 100 lines of scrolling is
divided into 15 steps

: (17 15 14 12 11 8 7 5 4 2 1 1 1 1 1)

and it looks smoother than 1 step scroll. note that last 5 steps are
all 1 line scrolls, because drift-length is set 5. so you may make
scroll more smooth by setting drift-length greater. try :

: (setq sublimity-scroll-weight 5
:       sublimity-scroll-drift-length 10)

with the configuration above, scroll is divided into 15 steps again,

: (30 24 18 12 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)

but last *10* steps are all 1 line scrollings. this looks smoother but
perhaps more annoying for some users.

** sublimity-map Settings
*** sublimity-map-size, sublimity-map-fraction

: (setq sublimity-map-size 20)
: (setq sublimity-map-fraction 0.3)

"sublimity-map-fraction" defines the maximum fraction of width that
minimap can get.

*** sublimity-map-setup-hook

: (add-hook 'sublimity-map-setup-hook
:           (lambda ()
:             (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "Monospace"))
:             (buffer-face-mode)))

"sublimity-map-setup-hook" will run when minimap is created.

*** sublimity-map-on-scroll

: (setq sublimity-map-on-scroll t)

When non-nil, minimap is automatically displayed on every scrolling.

*** sublimity-map-on-commands

: (setq sublimity-map-on-commands
:       '(previous-line next-line backward-paragraph forward-paragraph
:                       end-of-defun beginning-of-defun))

Set this variable to a list of command names, after which minimap
should be updated. If one of these commands are invoked, minimap is
updated even when scroll does not occur.

*** sublimity-map-set-delay

: (sublimity-map-set-delay 5)

With settings above, minimap is displayed after 5 seconds of idle
time. You can also cancel this timer, by passing "'inf" to
sublimity-map-delay.

: (sublimity-map-set-delay 'inf)

** Known Bugs, Limitations

+ if sublimity-scroll does not animate scroll correctly, try to load
  sublimity at the bottom of your init file (perhaps some libraries
  conflict with sublimity in post/pre-command-hook, and reordering hooks
  possibly solve the problem)
